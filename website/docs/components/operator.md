# Operator

The App Services operator provides the ability to expose service configuration to the users of an OpenShift cluster. This can be later injected into end user applications using the Service Binding Operator. The RHOAS operator is not designed to work on itâ€™s own and has a number of integrations with the App Services CLI and the OpenShift Console UI (from version 4.8). The app services operator provides a simple way to add more services. For more information about operator please refer to the documentation
