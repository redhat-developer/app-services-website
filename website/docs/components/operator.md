# Operator

https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-operator

The RHOAS operator provides the ability to expose service configuration to the users of an OpenShift cluster. This can be later injected into end user applications using the Service Binding Operator. The RHOAS operator is not designed to work on itâ€™s own and has a number of integrations with the RHOAS CLI and the OpenShift Console UI (from version 4.8). The RHOAS operator provides a simple way to add more services. For more information about operator please refer to the documentation
