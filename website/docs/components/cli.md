# CLI

The App Services CLI provides a way to interact with Application Service. The CLI provides extensibility capabilities to onboard new services

CLI features for all services:

- Authentication and authorization for cloud.redhat.com services
- The ability to set the service context so that the user can specify a “current” instance to work against
- The ability to connect services together to build more complex (for example to use setup a Kafka consumer to use Service Registry)
- Ability to connect and bind all services to end user applications (using App Services operator)
