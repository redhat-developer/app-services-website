# SDKs

The RHOAS SDK (currently under development) is the base building block for the entire RHOAS Developer ecosystem and is used by all our tools - the CLI (written in Golang), the Operator (written in Java) - and the UI (written in TypeScript/React). The SDKs also allow third party developers to build innovative integrations

## When to use SDKâ€™s:

You are building the cloud.redhat.com UI, RHOAS CLI or the RHOAS operator - the SDKs are used in all these components
You are building another integration and want to benefit from using a tested client, with mocks
