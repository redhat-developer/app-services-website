# App Services Developer Platform Resources

## Overview


This document provides information about the components, development practices, tools of Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) to be used by developers looking to understand our architecture and extensibility patterns.
The RHOAS tools focus on the developer experience for Red Hatâ€™s Application Services by building a set of tools, SDKs and software patterns that aggregate services and make them consumable by end users and their frameworks of choice. 

The RHOAS ecosystem tries to replicate the user experience that we see in major cloud providers like (AWS and Google) by providing a number of tools like a UI module, a CLI extension and availability on the OpenShift platform for each application service.
We aim to minimize the effort required to make any future service available to, and consumable by, end users in a consistent fashion.
